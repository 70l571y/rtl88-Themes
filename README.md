# Solarized-Dark-Returns
GTK and Gnome-Shell, Dark Mode Theme, Largely Based on the Official Color Pallet Created by Ethan Schoonover.

Brought back to the GUI, by popular demand, Solarized-Dark, originally created by Ethan Schoonover, is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. This GTK and Gnome-Shell dark-mode-scheme implements much of Ethan Schoonover's color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions. ~ https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

This GTK and GNOME Shell theme represents a careful blending of Numix elements; in tandem with those of minimalist, genus Rafa Capoci; with an overlay of the original, standard, Solarized-Dark, theming created by Ethan Schoonover. 

The GTK metatheme also provides support for xfwm4, openbox-3.
