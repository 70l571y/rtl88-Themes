Enchanted-Complete-System-Sounds will fill your computer with added life, but only in a way that improves the experience - versus overwhelming it. You will immediately be transformed into a universe where pleasant and reassuring conformations follow you everywhere go. 

These theme has been well-tested for GTK

A hardy thanks to the folks at Hamster Republic: "https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Free_Sound_Effects" for some great effects, the people at Big Soundbank: "bigsoundbankhttps://bigsoundbank.com/" for the bulk of what you hear here, and the contributors at: "https://notificationsounds.com/sound-effects" who round the theme with a couple of enchanted sounds.

Install Sound Theme:
Extract the zip files. Copy or mover the entire folder to below directory: /usr/share/sounds

Configure Sound Theme for GTK:
Use "dconf-editor" and navigate to the org / gnome / desktop / sound - and select click theme-name.

Enter Enchanted-Complete-System-Sounds as the folder name of your sound theme which you copied to /usr/share/sounds directory. 

Close the dconf-editor and logout/login.

Enjoy your new Enchanted sounds
