# Solarized-Dark-gtk-theme-and-icons-colorpack 
A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Dark Mode Theme and Icon Set- Based on the Official Color Pallet Created by Ethan Schoonover.

Choose from the official Blue, Cyan, Green, Magenta, Orange, Red, and Violet flavors. 

Brought back to the GUI by popular demand, Solarized-Dark - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Delivering GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell dark-mode-schemes, this GUI-centric theme strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark - it is hard to go back to anything else. Matching icons and folders are now available here in a separate package.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of modernized Numix elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, with an overlay of the original standard Solarized-Dark theming created by Ethan Schoonover.

Icons, with folders, represent custom blended color and selections among the Sardi Ghost Flexible, Papirus & ArchDroid schemes with Android Lollipop's material design overlay. Directories furnished are: actions/scalable,animations/scalable,apps/scalable,categories/scalable,devices/scalable,emblems/scalable,mimetypes/scalable,places/scalable,status/scalable,stock/scalable.

Manual installation for the Solarized-Dark-gtk-theme and the icons-colorpack is easy. 

For the theme: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your  "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

For the icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your  "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems, to fully implement themes and icons. 

If installing the Solarized-Dark-gtk-theme manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.


Roboto and Roboto-Medium are the UI fonts, and Validus is the icon theme shown in the screenshots.
